Install and configure the EB CLI
If you haven’t already, install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI:

bash
Copy
pip install awsebcli
From your app’s root directory, initialize your EB project:

bash
Copy
eb init -p docker hvac-dashboard --region ca-central-1
-p docker tells EB you’re using a single‑container Docker platform.

Choose the application name hvac-dashboard (or whatever you like).

When prompted, say yes to create an SSH key if you ever want to SSH into the EC2.

3. Create and deploy your environment
Create a new environment (beanstalk will build your image, spin up EC2, attach load balancer, etc.):

bash
Copy
eb create hvac-dashboard-env
You can add flags like --instance_type t3.small or --scale 2 if needed.

Monitor the deployment logs in your terminal. Once it ends with Environment health has transitioned to OK, you’re live.

4. Access your app
Run:

bash
Copy
eb open
This will open something like http://hvac-dashboard-env.eba-xxxxxx.ca-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com.

You can now hit that URL from any device—mobile or desktop.

5. (Optional) Update your app
Whenever you make changes locally:

bash
Copy
# rebuild & redeploy
eb deploy
Elastic Beanstalk will push the new Docker image and restart your containers seamlessly.
